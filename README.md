# HousePrice_Regression-Prediction
I have modelled an advanced regression model that accurately predicted property values with an 82% accuracy rate. I used statistical algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) by leveraging a sizable dataset. Each stage, from careful data cleansing to perceptive visualization, was carried out with great care to guarantee the stability and dependability of the model. This project demonstrates my skills in machine learning and data analysis and my capacity to provide solutions with a significant impact by using a strict process and paying close attention to detail.
